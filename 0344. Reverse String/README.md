### [344. Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

##### Level Easy

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

 

Example 1:
```JS
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```


Example 2:
```JS
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

##### Constraints:
```JS
1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is a printable ascii character.
```
