### [283. Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

#####Level Easy

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
```JS
nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
```
Output: 
```JS
[1,3,12,0,0]
```


Example 2:

Input: 
```JS
nums = [0]
```
Output: 
```JS
[0]
```

Constraints:
```JS
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
```
