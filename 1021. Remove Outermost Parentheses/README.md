### [1021. Remove Outermost Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-outermost-parentheses/)

###### Easy

A valid parentheses string is either empty "", "(" + A + ")", or A + B, where A and B are valid parentheses strings, and + represents string concatenation.

For example, "", "()", "(())()", and "(()(()))" are all valid parentheses strings.
A valid parentheses string s is primitive if it is nonempty, and there does not exist a way to split it into s = A + B, with A and B nonempty valid parentheses strings.

Given a valid parentheses string s, consider its primitive decomposition: s = P1 + P2 + ... + Pk, where Pi are primitive valid parentheses strings.

Return s after removing the outermost parentheses of every primitive string in the primitive decomposition of s.

 

Example 1:
```JS
Input: s = "(()())(())"
Output: "()()()"
```

Explanation: 
```JS
The input string is "(()())(())", with primitive decomposition "(()())" + "(())".
After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "()()" + "()" = "()()()".
```


Example 2:
```JS
Input: s = "(()())(())(()(()))"
Output: "()()()()(())"
```


Explanation: 
```JS
The input string is "(()())(())(()(()))", with primitive decomposition "(()())" + "(())" + "(()(()))".
After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "()()" + "()" + "()(())" = "()()()()(())".
```


Example 3:
```JS
Input: s = "()()"
Output: ""
```

Explanation: 
```JS
The input string is "()()", with primitive decomposition "()" + "()".
After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "" + "" = "".
```

Constraints:
```JS
1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is either '(' or ')'.
s is a valid parentheses string.
```
