### [448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/)

##### Easy

Given an array nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n], return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not appear in nums.

 

Example 1:
```JS
Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [5,6]
```

Example 2:
```JS
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [2]
```

Constraints:
```JS
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= n
```
